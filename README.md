<ul>
<li>Clone the repository into your local environment</li>
<li>Open the index.html file</li>
<li>Right click and select 'Open Default browser' to open the project in your default browser. </li>
<li>Click 'Add PacMan'button to generate a pacman on the page</li>
<li>Click 'Start Game' button to make the pacman move on the screen</li>
</ul>

<h3>Roadmap of future improvements</h3>
<p>Could add a stop button to stop the game. The game could also be adjusted to include avoiding collisions with the other pacmen instead of only the inner window borders. There could possibly be
a counter implemented with the game and some additional user interaction to push the stop button before any pacman collisions occur. Adding a pacman could be equivalent to moving up to the next level in the game.Another factor could be to increase the speed of the pacman for each level too.
